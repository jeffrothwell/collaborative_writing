He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
As he walked through the dark forest, a floating castle appeared in the sky.
He could hear the screams of a woman in distress coming from the castle.
In the distance, he could see a woman in a red dress, with hair as long as he could see.
There was a screeching howl in the distance and this frightened him.
But he ran towards the scream.
His hands clenched and his palms began to sweat.
It was a dark and stormy night!
